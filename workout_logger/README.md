# 🏋️ Workout Logger System

This is a small system design practice project to simulate tracking workouts.

## Features:
- Adds workouts with type, time, and date
- Saves to file using Python's file I/O
- Reads back all saved workouts

## Classes:
- `Workout`: data class for workout info
- `WorkoutLogger`: handles saving/loading from file

## Why:
Part of my preparation for system design interviews and building OOP fluency.
